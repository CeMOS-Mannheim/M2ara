# M²ara - MALDI MS Bioassays Evaluation and Classification App

M²ara is a novel software tool to facilitate the exploration of metabolomic responses in complex matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS) bioassays. This app intented for the evaluation of metabolomic drug actions by using the mass-to-charge ratios of hundreds of metabolites and it is particularly useful in defining novel pharmacodynamic biomarkers for high-throughput applications.

## How to use

This application simplifies the analysis of Molecular High Content Screening (MHCS) MALDI-TOF MS assay data and the evaluation of complex drug actions. After your data has been loaded, you can adjust settings as needed and start the processing. From here, you can analyze your data by selecting entries in the data table, visually inspect and rank mass features using the Curve Response Score (CRS) fingerprints, and save the curve fit and peak profile of your chosen m/z value. 

This app is specifically designed for use with Bruker flex series raw data but also features support for mzML.

## How to install 

Either clone the GitHub repository to your local machine and start the app by sourcing the `app.R` file or use the stand-alone installer (Windows only, no R installation needed).
The installer can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/CeMOS-Mannheim/M2ara/releases/download/1.0/MALDIcellassay_1.0.exe).
