### Single-point-recalibration

***

To improve mass accuracy and signal strength (``mean spectrum calculation`` leads to higher signals if peaks are well aligned) a ``single-point-recalibration`` may be performed. Usually the best practice is to include an internal standard or to use a known biological signal that should be independent of the treatment (e.g. PC34:1, m/z 760.585, that is abundantly present in cell membranes).

The signal used for the ``single-point-recalibration`` is defined with the ``m/z`` and ``Tol.`` setting.

You can change the settings here after loading your data and apply them by hitting the **Process Spectra**-Button without the need to reload you data!
